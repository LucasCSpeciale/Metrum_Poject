# LLM Performance Analysis Report

## Executive Summary
Based on the benchmark data from NVIDIA GenAI-Perf, we've analyzed three models: GPT-4o Mini, Claude 3 Haiku, and Llama 3.1 8B. The testing was conducted with consistent 50-token inputs over a 60-second window.

Key findings:
- Claude 3 Haiku demonstrates the best balance of performance and reliability
- GPT-4o Mini shows the most consistent latency
- Llama 3.1 8B has the highest variability in performance but can generate longer outputs

## Performance Comparison Ranking

1. **Claude 3 Haiku**
   - Best output token throughput (92.09 tokens/sec)
   - Balanced latency (avg 2,177ms)
   - Most consistent performance profile

2. **GPT-4o Mini**
   - Good reliability metrics
   - Moderate throughput (45.03 tokens/sec)
   - Shortest average output length

3. **Llama 3.1 8B**
   - Highest latency variability
   - Lower throughput (55.52 tokens/sec)
   - Most inconsistent performance

## Use-Case Recommendations

**Claude 3 Haiku**

- Recommended for: Non-time-critical applications

## Notable Insights

### Latency Analysis
- Claude 3 Haiku has the lowest average latency (2,177ms)
- GPT-4o Mini shows the most consistent p99 latency
- Llama 3.1 8B shows concerning latency spikes (up to 72,947ms)

### Throughput Characteristics
- Claude 3 Haiku leads in token throughput (92.09 tokens/sec)
- GPT-4o Mini maintains steady but lower throughput
- Llama 3.1 8B processes fewer requests but with longer outputs

### Output Patterns
- Llama 3.1 8B: Highest average output length (305.05 tokens)
- Claude 3 Haiku: Balanced output length (200.55 tokens)
- GPT-4o Mini: Most concise outputs (100.69 tokens)

## Conclusions & Recommendations

1. **For Production Deployments**
   - Primary: Deploy Claude 3 Haiku for best overall performance
   - Secondary: Use GPT-4o Mini for latency-sensitive applications

2. **Infrastructure Planning**
   - Implement timeout mechanisms (especially for Llama 3.1 8B)
   - Consider load balancing for high-traffic scenarios
   - Monitor p99 latencies to ensure SLA compliance

3. **Cost-Performance Optimization**
   - Use GPT-4o Mini for short-form content
   - Reserve Llama 3.1 8B for batch processing
   - Leverage Claude 3 Haiku for balanced workloads

4. **Risk Mitigation**
   - Implement retry logic for Llama 3.1 8B
   - Set appropriate timeouts based on p99 latencies
   - Consider fallback options for critical applications

This analysis suggests that Claude 3 Haiku offers the best overall performance for most use cases, while GPT-4o Mini provides the most predictable performance. Llama 3.1 8B, while capable of longer outputs, requires careful implementation due to its performance variability.
